## üìä URL Analysis Methodology

PhishGuard employs a sophisticated four-step analysis process:

1. **Blacklist Check**: Compares against known malicious domains
2. **Whitelist Check**: Validates against trusted domains
3. **Safe Browsing API**: Queries Google's Safe Browsing database
4. **ML Analysis**: Extracts 50+ features from the URL and applies our trained machine learning model

The risk score is calculated using a weighted algorithm that considers:
- Domain age and registration information
- URL structure and characteristics
- SSL/TLS certificate status
- Redirect patterns
- Google indexing status
- IP-based hosting detection
- And many other security indicators
