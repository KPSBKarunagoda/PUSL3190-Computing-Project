The URL received a risk score of 53, classifying it as a medium risk. While our analysis does not definitively label this URL as phishing (is_phishing: false), the score suggests some caution is warranted.  Further investigation may be necessary before interacting with this site.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Risk Indicators</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Indicator 1: Moderate Risk Score:</strong> A score of 53 falls within the medium risk range. While not definitively malicious, it suggests potential concerns that warrant further scrutiny.</li>\n<li><strong>Indicator 2: Absence of SSL Certificate (tls_ssl_certificate: 0):</strong>  This website does not appear to use an SSL certificate.  SSL certificates encrypt communication between your browser and the website, protecting sensitive information.  The absence of an SSL certificate is a significant security concern, especially for sites handling logins or financial data.</li>\n<li><strong>Indicator 3: Generic Domain Name:</strong> The domain name \"newstartup2023.com\" is somewhat generic and could be easily created for malicious purposes. While not inherently dangerous, it adds to the overall risk profile.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Technical Assessment</h3>\n<p>The URL \"newstartup2023.com/\" is relatively simple in structure. It consists of a domain name (\"newstartup2023.com\") and a top-level domain (\"com\"). The absence of subdirectories, file names, or parameters suggests a basic website structure.  However, the lack of an SSL certificate (tls_ssl_certificate: 0) is a major concern.  Without SSL, any information submitted to this website could be intercepted by third parties.  Additionally, the analysis did not detect any MX records (qty_mx_servers: 0) which are typically used for email communication.  This could indicate a newly registered domain or a site not intended for extensive user interaction.</p>\n\n<h3>What This Means For You</h3>\n<p>Visiting this site might expose you to certain risks.  Without an SSL certificate, any login credentials, personal information, or financial details you enter could be stolen.  Furthermore, the medium risk score suggests the possibility of deceptive practices.  Exercise caution before interacting with this website, especially if you are prompted to enter sensitive information.</p>\n\n<h3>Recommended Actions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Verify the Website's Legitimacy:</strong> Conduct further research about \"newstartup2023.com\". Look for reviews, contact information, and other evidence of its authenticity.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Entering Sensitive Information:</strong>  Do not enter any login credentials, personal details, or financial information on this site, especially since it lacks an SSL certificate.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact the Site Owners:</strong> If you have any doubts, try to contact the website owners directly through a verified channel (if available) to confirm their legitimacy.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider Alternatives:</strong>  If you are unsure about this website's trustworthiness, look for alternative sources or websites that offer similar services or information.</li>\n</ul>\n"}
