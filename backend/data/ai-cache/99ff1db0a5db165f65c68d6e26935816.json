{"timestamp":"2025-04-27T18:47:52.492Z","content":"<h2>Phishing Risk Analysis</h2>\n<p>Our analysis of the URL <strong>https://google.com</strong> indicates a very low risk of phishing, with a risk score of 15. The site appears legitimate and exhibits characteristics of a trusted website.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Risk Indicators</h3>\n<p>While the URL exhibits very few risk indicators, some features are worth noting for educational purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Short Domain Activation Time Relative to Expiration:</strong> While the domain has existed for a significant period (represented by `time_domain_activation`), the relatively shorter time until expiration (`time_domain_expiration`) could be a point to consider.  Legitimate, long-standing websites typically maintain longer expiration periods.  However, in conjunction with other positive indicators, this alone isn't a significant concern for this particular URL.</li>\n<li><strong>Single Redirect:</strong> The presence of a single redirect (`qty_redirects`: 1) is common and not necessarily a risk in itself. However, redirects can sometimes be used to mask the final destination of a link.  Given the low-risk nature of this URL and its established legitimacy, this redirect is unlikely to be malicious.</li>\n<li><strong>Length of Time Until Domain Expiration:</strong> The `time_domain_expiration` value of 1235 is relatively low.  While not a definitive indicator of phishing, shorter expiration times can sometimes be associated with malicious websites that are not intended for long-term use.  However, this is not a major concern for a well-established domain like google.com.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Technical Assessment</h3>\n<p>The URL utilizes HTTPS (`tls_ssl_certificate`: 1), indicating a secure connection. The domain, \"google.com,\" is well-established and widely recognized. The URL structure is simple and lacks any suspicious characters or patterns often associated with phishing attempts.  The presence of MX servers (`qty_mx_servers`: 1) and a valid SPF record (`domain_spf`: 1) further supports its legitimacy.  The URL and domain are indexed by Google (`domain_google_index`: 1, `url_google_index`: 1), which is typical for legitimate websites. The low number of dots, hyphens, and other special characters in the URL and domain is also a positive sign.</p>\n\n<h3>What This Means For You</h3>\n<p>This URL is highly likely to be safe.  The risk of encountering phishing or other malicious activity on this site is extremely low.  It is unlikely that your information would be compromised by visiting this URL.</p>\n\n<h3>Recommended Actions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can proceed to the website without significant concern.</li>\n<li>While this site is likely safe, maintaining good online safety practices is always recommended. Be cautious about entering sensitive information even on trusted sites unless necessary.</li>\n<li>If you encounter any unexpected behavior on the website, such as requests for unusual information or unexpected downloads, it's best to leave the site and report the issue.</li>\n<li>Familiarize yourself with the general structure of the Google URL (https://google.com) so you can identify potential discrepancies in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n"}
